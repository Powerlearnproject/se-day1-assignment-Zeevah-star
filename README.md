Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry..
ans: software engineering  is a technique we use to create softwares for computer systems and electronic devices.

importance: software engineering is important in the technology industry because it uses a well defined scientific
method, principle and proceedure to develop a software.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
ans: a- structured programming (structured programming advocated for the use of clear, logical structure in code.)
 
 b- Waterfall model- formalised software development as a sequential process with distinct phases like 
 implementation, design, requirment and maintainance

 c- Ai and mmachine learning- the integration of Ai and machine learning has opened new possibilities for automation and
  intelligent systems.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
ans-* plannining (involves resource planning, conducting feasibility analysis, and creation of project plan or timeline)
    * Requirement Analysis (it involves discussion with stakeholders to understand what the software should do and how it should function)
    * Design (involves creating the software architecture and design specifications.)
    * Implementation (The actual code is written based on the design specification)
    * Testing (After the software is developed it undergoes rigorous testing to identify and fix any defects or issues)
    * Deployment (After successful testing, the product is deployed to the production enviorment where it becomes accessible to the end users)
    * Maintainance (The software is monitored for any bug or issues that may arise)


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

ans- Comparison: 
Flexibility: waterfall is rigid and liner, while Agile is flexible and continuously evolving
Change management: Waterfall is less accomodating to change, whereas Agile embraces changes even late in the project
Customer Involvement: Waterfall involves the customer mainly at the end and beginning, while Agile involves the customer throughout the project.
* Example scenerios for waterfall - The Development of a medical device: requires thorough documentation, rigorous testing, and adherence to
regulatory standards.
* Example scenerio for Agile - Developing a mobile app.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
ans-
Software developer:Problem solving - Identify and resolves software bugs, performance issues and technical challenges 
Quality assurance engineer: Test case design - Create detailed, clear and comprehensive test cases that cover all functional and non functional specifications
Project manager in a software engineering team: Define the project scope, objectives and deleverables in collaboration with stakeholders.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Ans: Integrated Development Enviornment is a software application that helps programmers develop code efficiently, it contains many intelligent features that 
automatically writes and edits codes.
Example of an IDE is the Visual studio code and pycharm.

The VCS helps to manage and track changes to code or files overtime.
Example of a VCS is the Distributed Version Control System (CVSC). Eg, Git/Github.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Ans: Time limitation = The deadlines set for software engineers are incredibly short and are one of the major challenges of being a software engineer. 
strategies: Creating informative and well-structured conversations with end consumers


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
ans. Unit Testing:
this is the testing of the smallest testable unit of an application.
importance of unit testing is it helps a developer to catch problems early innthe development of software, before the code is Integrated with other components.

integration testing:
ensures that all component of a product works together correctly.
its evaluates system perfprmance.

system testing:
system testing is a process of evaluating an entire softwware system to ensure it meets specified demand.
importance of system testing, it ensures that the final product is of high quality.

Acceptance testing:
This is a type of testing conducted to determine if a system meets the requirment and is ready to be deployed to the customer.
importance: It validates that all user expectation and business needs are met.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
ans: prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining instructions given to AI models to get desired responses.
importance: it helps to give clear, specific and direct prempt/instruction to get desired responses.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Ans: 'play a song' is an example of a vague prompt, while 'Play on my way, by Alan walker' is a more improved way to make a prompt, and this improved method is 
more effective because it is well defined by stating the music title to stating the artists name, this way the instuction is clear and direct band the knows
exactly the desired response to the prompt.
